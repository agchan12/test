#Compromises

There isn't much to compromise in this short assignment. Given the time constraints, and fact that I had never programmed in Ruby before, I was objectively seeking on completing exactly what was set out to me.

A few things I have in mind to to improve the webpages:

- Add more HTML formatting

- Decorate the page with CSS and JavaScript
